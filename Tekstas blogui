PCs can just convey utilizing arrangement of numbers, so DNS was created as a kind of "telephone directory" that interprets the space you enter in your program into a PC meaningful IP.
Thirty years prior, when the Internet was still in its earliest stages when you needed to visit a site you needed to know the IP address of that webpage. That is on account of PCs are and were just ready to convey utilizing numbers. This is an IP address: 127.33.54.200.
It's long, hard to recollect, and we (people, I assume) are not robots. We required an approach to make an interpretation of PC clear data into comprehensible. What's more, it must be quick, lightweight, and versatile.
In the mid 1980's, Paul Mockapetris concocted a framework that naturally mapped IP delivers to area names.. furthermore, the DNS was conceived. This same framework still fills in as the foundation of the cutting edge Internet, today.
